** TODO

* Allow re-applying (have to allow them to choose to continue old or start a new one).
* Add progress bars to the website so you know how much you've got left
* On the last page, Receive communications box - change this to a checkbox with 'No' - unticked by default (tick means NO)
* Add 'preferred start date below entry date' - Dropdown month [Sep, Nov, Feb, April], Dropdown year [2011, 2012]
* Section 6 - 3 questions always show. If 'No' is selected then the rest appear, otherwise hide them.

** Change to College Website

* College Website: course pages - bold the level so it's easier to see
