## Cache
Pages on the website are cached and saved as '.scp' files inside the [cache](/conel/conel-website/tree/master/cache) folder.  
When you make changes to pages inside webmatrix you may need to clear the cache to see them.  
I've created a batch file - that sits on the desktop of - that you can use to clear the cache.
